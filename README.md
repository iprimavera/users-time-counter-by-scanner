# users time counter by scanner

To run the scanner, use `./scanner.sh`
To see the calendar and users data, run `./display.sh`

## How to use the scanner

The scanner is very simple. when executed, it automatically creates all the required files and starts listening for an ID (with the scanner).

When a new ID is read, the scanner asks for the user's full name and email address.

The scanner must be reset if the day has changed since its last reset (before first use of the day).
